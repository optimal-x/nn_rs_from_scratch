# **linalg**  

### **Overview**  

`linalg` is a simple, purpose-built linear algebra crate designed for the `nn_rs_from_scratch` project. Its goal is to provide a minimal yet functional foundation for understanding and implementing neural networks without unnecessary complexity.  

This library is built **for learning and experimentation**, not for high-performance applications. It doesn't include SIMD optimizations or GPU accelerationâ€”just the essential operations needed to develop and test different AI models in a clear and reusable way.  

In short the linalg crate is a **lightweight, educational** linear algebra toolkit to help you build neural networks from scratch.
